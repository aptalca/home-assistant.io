This procedure shows you how to create a text-to-speech action using Piper, our local text-to-speech engine, and the media player service. Home Assistant can then speak to you over your media player as part of an automation.

1. Go to **{% my automations title="Settings > Automations & Scenes" %}**, and select **Create automation**.
1. Select **Create new automation**, then **Add action**.
1. From the drop-down menu, select **Play media** and select the media player you want to use for this automation.
